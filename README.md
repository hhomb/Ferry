## Overview  
This repository accompanies the paper:  
**"Design of a Decision Support System for Energy-Efficient Ferry Operation on Lake Constance based on Optimal Control"**  

The work addresses the **energy-efficient operation of inland ferries** by combining:  
- ðŸš¢ A dynamic model of the ferry *MS Insel Mainau*  
- ðŸŽ¯ A shrinking-horizon optimal control framework  
- ðŸŒŠ Environmental disturbances (water currents, wind)  
- âš¡ Real-time decision support for ferry crews

## Abstract  
The maritime sector is undergoing a disruptive technological change driven by autonomy, decarbonization, and digitalization. Addressing these factors necessitates a reassessment of inland vessel operations.  

This paper presents the **design and technical development of a decision support system for ferry operation** grounded in a shrinking-horizon optimal control framework. The formulation integrates a **mathematical model of the ferryâ€™s dynamics** and **environmental disturbances**, specifically water currents and wind, which can significantly affect operations.  

Illustrative experiments demonstrate the systemâ€™s potential to:  
- Provide **real-time, actionable guidance** (nudges) to the crew  
- Enhance **operational efficiency**  
- Maintain predefined maneuver durations  
- Ensure **computational tractability** for real-time applications  

The findings suggest that optimal control can advance and potentially transform ferry operations on inland waters.
